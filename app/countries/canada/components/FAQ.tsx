            What is the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) in Canada?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) allows international students who have completed eligible programs at designated Canadian institutions to work in Canada for up to three years after graduation. The permit length depends on your study program duration. This valuable pathway gives graduates Canadian work experience, which can help with permanent residency applications through programs like the Canadian Experience Class. To be eligible, you must have studied full-time and completed a program of at least 8 months at a DLI.

            Can international students work while studying in Canada?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Yes, international students with a valid study permit can work up to 20 hours per week during academic sessions and full-time during scheduled breaks like summer and winter holidays. This work authorization is automatically included with most study permits and does not require a separate work permit. On-campus employment has no hour restrictions. Your spouse or common-law partner may also be eligible for an open work permit while you study. Working while studying helps offset costs and provides valuable Canadian work experience, which can be beneficial for future immigration applications.
