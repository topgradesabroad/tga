            How do I apply for a French student visa?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            To study in France, non-EU/EEA students generally need a long-stay student visa (visa de long séjour étudiant). First, secure admission to a recognized French institution, then apply through Campus France (if applicable) and at the French embassy or consulate in your country. You'll need proof of university admission, financial evidence (such as a blocked account or bank statement showing funds sufficient to cover around €615 per month), health insurance, academic transcripts, and language proficiency (French or English, depending on your program). Processing times vary, so apply at least 2-3 months before your planned departure.

            What is the Post-Study Work visa in France?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            After completing your degree in France, international graduates can apply for a temporary residence permit to stay and search for a job related to their field of study. This permit, often known as the Autorisation Provisoire de Séjour (APS), is typically granted for 12 months, although doctoral graduates might be eligible for a longer period. Once you secure a relevant job, you can apply for a long-term work permit or a skilled worker visa. Gaining sufficient work experience can also pave the way to permanent residency.
